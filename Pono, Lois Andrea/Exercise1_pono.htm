<p>In the teaser, the members are shown having a blast with their time in Italy as they explore the streets and go sightseeing with PD Na Young Suk as their tour guide.</p>

<p>The previously released highlight teaser also features the members enjoying Italy in their own way. Jeonghan takes care of the members, Joshua and Jun take in the vacation vibes, Hoshi has a blast being with the members, and Wonwoo appears to be enjoying every aspect of Italy.</p> 

<p>Woozi, who normally enjoys staying indoors, also participates in exploring Italy, The8 and Mingyu express their great satisfaction with the trip, DK and Seungkwan raise anticipation for the comedic moments, and Vernon and Dino share their knowledge and advice on tour.</p>

<p>Already, viewers are highly anticipating the teamwork SEVENTEEN will showcase on the tear and how they will enjoy their vacation to Italy.</p>
