1.Hiragana is a cursive, graceful writing system composed of symbols derived by modifying portions of kanji. <br> 
2.It is one of the two parts of the Japanese alphabet, the other being Katakana. <br> 
3.Modern Hiragana consists of 46 syllables. <br> 
4.Hiragana is used with grammatical words, particles, sounds that follow after kanji, and for words that either don't have a kanji or the kanji is too difficult for the writer. <br>
5.Except the N sound (ã‚“), every hiragana represents a single sound/syllable in the Japanese language.</h3>
