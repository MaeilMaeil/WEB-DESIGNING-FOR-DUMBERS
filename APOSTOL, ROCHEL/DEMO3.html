<p> I've always been afraid
<p>My best years have passed
<p>They say the good old days
<p>Well, they never last
<p>I've been running into you in my head
<p>In-between, what could've been, yeah-yeah-yeah
<p>Everybody seems to leave bittersweet memories
<p>Time does seem to fly
<p>Then it's hard to find, yeah
<p>Used to dine and dash, run and laugh
<p>Skinny-dip off a ship, oh-whoa-whoa
<p>Not a worry for a million miles
<p>Driving off, be right back, oh-whoa-whoa
<p>'Cause baby, after all of this time
<p>We'll meet again, with time to spend
<p>'Cause even after all of this time, would you be mine?
<p>'Cause I'd drop it all just to get you
<p>Bring me back to life
<p>Bring me back to life, yeah
