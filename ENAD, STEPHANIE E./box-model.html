<div> GOT7 is a flagship boy group formed by South Korean agency JYP Entertainment (JYPE), which debuted in 2014. Initially, JYPE founder Park Jin-young wanted to name the group “GET7,” but immediately retracted from the idea because it didn't sound right.

  The group is comprised of seven members, namely JAY B, Mark, Jackson, Jinyoung, Youngjae, Bambam, and Yugyeom, and was named GOT7, which means “seven lucky people coming together.” </div>
