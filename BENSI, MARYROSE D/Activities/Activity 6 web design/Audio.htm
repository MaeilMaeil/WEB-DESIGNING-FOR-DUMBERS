        We dream of this wonderful time, now we want a reality
        Where we can smoke marijuana every day without noÿ apologies
        And even when we eyes them red like blood, Babylon can't pene we
        'Cause a da healing of the nation
        And H.I.M. no want no aggravation
        Youthman step out inna Babylon face
        Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
        Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high like birds in the sky we fly
        Youthman step out inna Babylon face
        Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
        Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high like birds in the sky we fly
        Watch how we do, burn a spliff
        Whole a medi, then we trail fi sendÿ Babylon go cemetery
        Where we mek we talk and try fi market
        Always dem a try find the weed dem want fi stop it
        So we roll the dutchie and we blaze up the kutchie
        Try to load the weed and Babylon dem can't touch it
        We want fi blaze every day
        We nah give a fuck what Babylon man say
        Youthman step out inna Babylon face
        Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
        Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
        Youthman step out inna Babylon face
        Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
        Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
        Yo we burn the herbs and get high
        Blaze it up in front of the policeman, ay
        Ganja we a smoke but the coke we nah try
        When dem ask you why tell them it was sent to I by The Most High
        It was found pon Solomon grave and him a the wisest man
        See the spliff inna mi hand youÿ better try get one
        We want nuff-nuff-nuff-nuff weed to go around
        Yo, from Jamaica we ship a thousand miles
        Youthman step out inna babylon face
        Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
        Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
